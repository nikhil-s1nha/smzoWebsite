# Email Setup for Contact Form

The contact form now has full email functionality that sends messages to `smilezonefamilydental@gmail.com`. To make it work, you need to set up email credentials.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Environment File
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
# For Gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail

# For Outlook/Hotmail
# EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
# EMAIL_PASS=your-password
# EMAIL_SERVICE=outlook

# For Yahoo
# EMAIL_USER=your-email@yahoo.com
# EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
# EMAIL_SERVICE=yahoo
```

### 2. Gmail App Password Setup
Since Gmail requires an App Password for SMTP access:

1. Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
3. Go to Security > App passwords
4. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" as the device
5. Generate the app password
6. Use this generated password in the `EMAIL_PASS` field

### 3. Alternative Email Services
If you prefer not to use Gmail, you can modify the API route (`app/api/contact/route.ts`) to use other email services like:
- SendGrid
- Mailgun
- AWS SES
- Outlook/Hotmail

### 4. Testing
Once configured, the contact form will:
- Send emails to `smilezonefamilydental@gmail.com`
- Include all form data (name, email, phone, subject, message)
- Show loading states and error handling
- Display success confirmation

### 5. Security Notes
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables for all sensitive credentials
- Consider using a dedicated email service for production
